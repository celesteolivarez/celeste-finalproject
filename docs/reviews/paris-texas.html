When a stranger manages to contact his brother, Walt (Dean Stockwell), Travis is awkwardly reunited with his sibling. Travis has been missing for years, and his presence unsettles Walt and his family, which also includes Travis&#39;s own son, Hunter (Hunter Carson). Soon Travis must confront his wife, Jane (Nastassja Kinski), and try to put his life back together.</p>

        <p class="mt-3" style="white-space: pre-line;">A new favorite of mine within the last two years. I have always been intimidated by Paris, Texas as a film for its longer runtime and big themes that I felt I might not be in the right place in life to appreciate. I was quickly immersed by the stunning footage of the warm desert landscape of Texas. The subtle but beautiful performance of Henry Dean Stanton will break your heart by the time credits roll. A beautifully tragic love story between an estranged father and son looking for their mother/wife.  This will be a film I watch every few years to see how it affects my view and understanding of life.</p>
