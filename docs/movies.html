                      This movie will always be my all-time favorite because of
                      how important it is in my life. I grew up watching this
                      movie every Christmas, and even when it wasn’t Christmas.
                      Jim Carrey’s performance continues to fascinate me with
                      each and every watch. In recent years, I have learned how
                      difficult it was for Carrey to sit through the Grinch
                      makeup. It went as far as training with the CIA to learn
                      anti-torture techniques. This movie has become part of my
                      personality, and I will only continue to watch it as I get
                      older.

                      Nacho Libre is another movie that carries importance in my
                      childhood. I grew up watching this with my brothers, and
                      it has become a movie I quote almost daily. It’s such a
                      hilarious watch each time and it will always make me
                      laugh. I love Jack Black.

                      I watched this movie recently and found myself crying
                      within the first five minutes of the film. Although I’ve
                      only seen it once, and under the circumstances I was
                      facing, this movie made me feel a certain way, and I’m
                      scared to watch it again. The emotions I felt were so
                      intense, and it was beautiful. I watched this with Ethan,
                      and I’m very happy I got to see it with him first. It
                      would have been different watching it with someone else or
                      alone. It’s another movie with Jim Carrey, so I got to say
                      I guess I love this guy.

                      This is a movie that holds a special place between me and
                      my mom. She showed me this movie for the first time 15
                      years ago. I love the mother and daughter duo in this film
                      and it reminds me of the relationship between my mother
                      and I. She is my best friend that tries to understand me,
                      laughs with me and gets on my nerves. Mamma Mia! will
                      forever make me grateful for my mom. This movie has such a
                      funny story line and the music is so fun. ABBA has become
                      a stable roadtrip band to play.

                      A movie I grew up loving and watching over and over. A
                      connection I have with my dad and brother. Every time I
                      watch it, I appreciate all the real practical sets and
                      makeup used on the vast races of goblins and hobbits. The
                      music by Howard Shore pairs beautifully with the gorgeous
                      landscape shots all across the New Zealand countryside and
                      mountains. A true hero journey from beginning to end.

                      A newer favorite of mine. Bong Joon Ho’s Memories of
                      Murder is a dark police procedural murder case, full of
                      dark comedy and a detective mystery. I love watching films
                      from other countries and seeing their point of view on the
                      life around us. Every time I watch this film, I seem to
                      understand and catch things I never noticed upon a first
                      watch. The mix of humor and seriousness should not work on
                      paper, but Bong is able to easily blend the two, giving
                      the audience a break from the bleak murders and suspense.

                      I was always culturally aware of Monty Python growing up,
                      but always pre assumed their comedy was dry British humor.
                      Not until I sat and watched this film with my brother did
                      I realize that Monty Python shares closer humor to
                      SpongeBob than to Saturday Night Live. I love the idea of
                      a group of friends getting together on a shoestring budget
                      and making the film they have always wanted to make. No
                      rules, just play. I consider this film and its humor ahead
                      of its time. I can see the inspiration carried into early
                      YouTube and modern day comedies. These blokes never take
                      themselves too seriously, you can see the film “self
                      expose” its own budget by showing the charcuterie
                      pretending to ride invisible horses. An easy watch anytime
                      with the lads.

                      A new favorite of mine within the last two years. I have
                      always been intimidated by Paris, Texas as a film for its
                      longer runtime and big themes that I felt I might not be
                      in the right place in life to appreciate. I was quickly
                      immersed by the stunning footage of the warm desert
                      landscape of Texas. The subtle but beautiful performance
                      of Henry Dean Stanton will break your heart by the time
                      credits roll. A beautifully tragic love story between an
                      estranged father and son looking for their mother/wife.
                      This will be a film I watch every few years to see how it
                      affects my view and understanding of life.
